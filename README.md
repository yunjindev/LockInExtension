# LockInExtension
A Firefox extension to keep you locked in. 

## Why?
Doomscrolling has become an addiction for me and a ton of others. This will not "lock" any of your apps you are not a child. Use the timer to keep you accountable and use the quote for some inspiration

## Features
- Set a pomodoro themed timer to have 25 minutes of working and then 5 of break.
- Get a random quote from me telling you to lock in
